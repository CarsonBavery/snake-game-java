# Classic Snake Game with Enhanced Features
Built a classic snake game in Java, following a foundational tutorial and adding custom features to enhance user experience. The project includes:

**Difficulty Selection:** Users can choose from multiple difficulty levels before starting the game.

**Interactive Start Screen:** A screen prompts users to press a button to advance to the game.

**Replay Option:** Allows users to replay the game without needing to restart the program.

**High Score Tracker:** Keeps track of the highest score during the current session.

The game was developed using java.awt for graphics rendering and event handling. A key challenge was implementing the replay feature and adapting new functionalities without breaking the core mechanics. Through constant testing and debugging, I ensured a smooth gameplay experience.

This project showcases my Java programming skills, particularly in object-oriented design, event handling, and GUI development.
